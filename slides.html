# Sport Climbing



International (indoor) climbing competitions have been held since 1980. Currently, the governing organization is the [International Federation of Sport Climbing](ifsc-climbing.org).

There are three disciplines: **lead**, **bouldering**, and **speed**.

# Climbing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics

Tokyo 2020 is the **first time** climbing will be an event in the Olympics! There will be one **combined** event for men and one for women. The winners will be determined based on who performs best in **all three** disciplines.

&gt; I think that speed climbing is an artificial discipline... which doesn't have much in common with the climbing philosophy. Anything would be better than this kind of combination. If the [Olympic] Games include the combination, I will have to think a lot about participating or boycotting it.

[Adam Ondra](https://www.epictv.com/media/podcast/adam-ondra-offers-his-opinion-about-climbing-in-the-olympic-games/604973)

&gt; [The decision to include speed climbing is like] asking a middle distance runner to compete in the sprint.

Lynn Hill

&gt; No boulderer has transitioned to speed and lead, and no speed climber has done it to bouldering and lead. Sport climbing is like asking Usain Bolt to run a marathon and then do the hurdles.

# Best climber in the world?

# Scoring Format &amp; Qualification

- There are 40 (20 men and 20 women) spots and each country can obtain a maximum of 2 spots in each event.

- There will be 8 spots in each final (men and women), determined by the qualification round. Medals will be awarded from the top 3 in each final.

- Scoring is determined by multiplying the climbers' rankings from each event.

    - e.g. If a climber comes in 1st in speed, 20th in bouldering and 20th in lead in the qualifying round, they will have a score of `\(1\times 20\times 20 = 400\)`
    
- Nobody has a good feel for the expected distribution of these scores, since this is a new format.

**Monte Carlo** to the rescue!

---

# Simulation Study

We can simulate event results by simply sampling rankings. 

**Assumption:** Speed specialists will come in top of the speed event and bottom of the lead and bouldering events.


```r
scores_rep &lt;- function(n, n_speed) {
  speed &lt;- lead &lt;- boulder &lt;- rep(NA, n)
  n_others &lt;- n - n_speed
  
  # speed should be top in speed and last in the others
  speed[seq_len(n_speed)] &lt;- sample(as.character(seq_len(n_speed)), n_speed)
  lead[seq_len(n_speed)] &lt;- sample(as.character(n_others + seq_len(n_speed)), n_speed)
  boulder[seq_len(n_speed)] &lt;- sample(as.character(n_others + seq_len(n_speed)), n_speed)
  
  # non speed specialists are the opposite
  speed[n_speed + seq_len(n_others)] &lt;- sample(as.character(n_speed + seq_len(n_others)), n_others)
  lead[n_speed + seq_len(n_others)] &lt;- sample(as.character(seq_len(n_others)), n_others)
  boulder[n_speed + seq_len(n_others)] &lt;- sample(as.character(seq_len(n_others)), n_others)

  as.numeric(speed)*as.numeric(boulder)*as.numeric(lead) # multiplicative rounds
}
```


---

# Distribution of Qualifier Scores


```r
B &lt;- 20000
n &lt;- 20
n_speed &lt;- 3 # there are 3 speed specialists qualified
scores_star &lt;- matrix(nrow = B, ncol = n)
for(i in seq_len(B)) {
  scores_star[i,] &lt;- scores_rep(n, n_speed)
}

summary(as.numeric(scores_star))
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##     4.0   320.0   684.0   933.7  1200.0  5780.0
```

# Distribution of Qualifier Scores for Specialists

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Qualifying for the Final

What is a good score? What score will get you into the final?


```r
finals_star &lt;- t(apply(scores_star, 1, rank)) &lt;= 8

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(scores_star[finals_star]), binwidth = 50) +
  xlab("Simulated Combined Scores Qualified for Finals")
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

If a climber has a score under 500, they have a 94% chance of qualifying for the finals.

---
# Speed Climbers Qualifying for the Final

How many speed climbers will qualify for the final?


```r
n_speed_final &lt;- rowSums(finals_star[, seq_len(n_speed)])

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(n_speed_final), binwidth = 1)
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

With probability 94%, there will be **1** speed climber in the final. There is a 4% chance there will be no speed climbers in the final.

---

# Finals Scores

There is a pretty high probability (94%) that the makeup of the final will be 1 speed climber and 7 non-speed climbers. 


```r
n &lt;- 8 
n_speed &lt;- 1 
scores_final_star &lt;- matrix(nrow = B, ncol = n)

for(i in seq_len(B)) {
  scores_final_star[i,] &lt;- scores_rep(n, n_speed)
}
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

With 1 speed climber in the final, their score is essentially fixed at 64.

---

# Medals

What will it take to **medal** in the Olympics?


```r
medals_star &lt;- t(apply(scores_final_star, 1, rank)) &lt;= 3

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(scores_final_star[medals_star]), binwidth = 5) +
  xlab("Simulated Combined Finals Scores to Medal") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 64), colour = "red", lty = 2)
```

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


```r
speed_medal &lt;- medals_star[, seq_len(n_speed)]
```

---

# Medals for Speed Specialists

There is a 3% chance the speed specialist will medal in the Olympics, given there is 1 in the final.

We can approximate the overall probability that a speed specialist (SS) will medal as

`\begin{align*}
&amp;P(\text{Atleast 1 Speed Specialist Medal}) = 1 - P(\text{0 Speed Specialists Medal})  \\
&amp;\qquad \qquad = 1 - \sum\limits_{j = 0}^3 P(\text{0 SS Medal} | \text{j SS in Final})P(\text{j SS in Final})
\end{align*}`

and the probability that a speed specialist will win gold as

`\begin{align*}
&amp;P(\text{Speed Specialist Wins Gold}) \\
&amp;\qquad \qquad = \sum\limits_{j = 0}^3 P(\text{Speed Specialist Wins Gold} | \text{j SS in Final})P(\text{j SS in Final})
\end{align*}`

---
# Probability of Speed Success


```r
zero_speed_given_final &lt;- function(n_speed, B) {
  scores_final_star &lt;- matrix(nrow = B, ncol = 8)
  for(i in seq_len(B)) {
    scores_final_star[i,] &lt;- scores_rep(8, n_speed)
  }
  
  medals_star &lt;- t(apply(scores_final_star, 1, rank)) &lt;= 3
  if(n_speed == 0) return(1)
  else if(n_speed == 1) return(sum(!medals_star[, 1])/B)
  else return(sum(rowSums(medals_star[, seq_len(n_speed)]) == 0)/B)
}

prob_speed_final &lt;- table(n_speed_final)/B
prob_zero_speed_given_final &lt;- vapply(as.numeric(names(prob_speed_final)), FUN.VALUE = numeric(1), zero_speed_given_final, B = B)
```


The probability of a speed specialist medal is 3% and the probability of a speed specialist winning gold is 0%

# Format over Function

The three core concepts of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games are **Achieving Personal Best**, **Unity in Diversity**, and **Connecting to Tomorrow**.

&gt; [T]he Tokyo 2020 Games aim to deliver an event where every athlete can realise their best performance and achieve their personal best.

&gt; The Tokyo 2020 Games will foster a welcoming environment and raise awareness of unity in diversity among citizens of the world.

[Tokyo 2020](https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/vision/)

The format that the Olympics has adopted for Sport Climbing does not foster these goals.

How can a speed specialist realize their **personal best** and feel part of a **welcoming environment** when there is zero chance for a gold medal before the games even begin?
